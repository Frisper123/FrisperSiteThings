  <h2> Who I am</h2> 
</div>
  <p>Born in the city of Bath and subsequently growing up in the countryside I have always found a fascination in nature and "adventure". Because of this I have pursued writing as a possible career and I have explored the genre of fantasy from an early age. Books, particularly those read to me by
    my parents helped upkeep that fascination. I am now studying at Oxford Brookes University at a course that allows for this exploration. I consider myself an introvert but when surrounded by friends I definintely come out of my shell more and recently I have been more and more willing to try
    new things. Living in the city of Oxford has also been a new adventure for me and so far I have been enjoying it wholeheartedly, benefitting from the balance of venues and beautiful architecture.

  <h3>My Interests and Hobbies</h3>
</div>

  <p>I have always considered myself a bit of a nerd when it comes to the media I consume. If it weren't illustrated information books on dinosaurs, military uniform or the like it was always some sort of fantasy content. I have always enjoyed the genres such as "Sci-fi" and "Cyberpunk".
  With works such as 'Star Wars' being amongst some of my favourites. However it is the genre of fantasy that has always fascinated me and has brought me back to that child-like state of joy. Because of this a few years ago (this year being 2021) I took it upon myself to become the "Dungeon Master"
  for a small group of our friends and started playing 'Dungeons and Dragons' we have been having immense fun and it has only solidified my love of the fantasy genre as I have had the opportunity to immerse myself in my own world and build it with the help of others. As well as this I skateboard,
  fish and also build, paint and play with 'Warhammer' figures. Writing has also always been a passion of mine and at the moment I find myself constructing my own seperate world as I find detailing the history and intricacies of a world to be nothing less than spectacular.

<h4> Enjoy the Site
</h4>

<p> I hope you enjoy looking around my site and begin to gain the same fascination I have with the fantasy genre as a whole and what is put into the graphic design and typography of the media that surrounds it. As formally mentioned I have always held this deep fascination with the genre and it is 
  my intention to find out why and how I have been gripped so readily. Especially considering my recent delve back into the written media of fantasy with Kentaro Miura's manga 'Berserk' which in all honesty I consider a complete masterpiece. But anyway, enjoy your stay here traveller, rest well
  and hopefully you shall learn something new.
