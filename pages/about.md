I have always been deeply intoxicated by the allure of different worlds and the ability to immerse myself in them. Because of this the fantasy genre has always been amn absolute favourite of mine and has taken me to said worlds without hesitation. I wanted to explore how typography within design involving fantasy has swayed my choice in picking up those books and films, it has worked on me and evidently has worked well on others too. I have found that a good typeface often is highly reflective of the contents of the media itself and so set me up well for what was in store and my expectations were set. These typefaces, the reasoning behind them and their effects shall be explored within this website in order to create a deeper understanding of all that has been mentioned.
