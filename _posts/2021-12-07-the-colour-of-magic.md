Typography also encompasses what type of colours are used within the lettering, helping convey certain emotions by drawing on already established sociatal implications. On first observation one can pick up on certain trends such as the use of silver and/or gold on many fantasy book covers.

Apart from silver and gold to portray the magical nature of certain works of fiction, red is also used a lot throughout fantasy, especially amongst those more associated with dark fantasy and violence. A prime example is 'Blood Ninja' by Nick Lake. The typography itself contains sharp serif that also has a blockier body, an attempt to reflect the anicent Japanese setting of the book. The choice of red is an obvious nod to the focus on vampirism and bloodlust. Red being associated with lust and violence, the potential reader already seeing
