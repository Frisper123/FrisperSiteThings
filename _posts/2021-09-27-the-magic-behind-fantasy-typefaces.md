Fantasy has always held a rather large chunk of any media, more specifically the UK's publishing industry sees fiction taking up 16% of its profits as of 2019. As well as this, in 2017 fantasy and sci-fi sold 3,225,915 units within the UK, making them the third best selling genre(s) of the year. 

With this it is obvious that these fantasy books are full of content that has been deemed worthwhile by the readers. However, the content is what kept the readers reading, not what made them decide to pick the book off of the shelf in the first place, at least if it were previously unknown to them. It is in fact the cover, the image, the name, the author and of course the typography. 

Typography associated with the genre and its art is impossible to deny within fantasy, for example 'Harry Potter' is practically a household name within the West and has seen many films and book editions and thus different typographic designs. However one thing that is certain is that the vast majority, if not all the instances contain serif and retains such a design throughout the texts on the covers. It is the reasoning behind decisions such as this that shall be explored throughout this blog. Questions such as "How does serif give this an air of fantasy?" and "What do certain colour choices convey in this typography?" are to be explored within this blog. 

Comparing the typography of the explicit fantasy genre with that of the Sci-fi genre will also yield results in terms of exploring the uniqueness of the fantasy typeface, weight and other such factors. A look into how the fantasy typography incorporates elements from their media's own worlds is also key as I believe that is part of the success of the design and so shall be explored further. 

The type of fantasy in tone and theme is often conveyed through the typography too. Whether it be high fantasy with flamboyant and colourful typeface or "grimdark" with hard, rigid typeface and cold colouring. This works in favour of drawing in the correct readers that are willing to engage with the content of the media more readily, thus allowing the media to be passed around the correct audiences and groupings and increasing sales. I want to add examples of these different sub-genres to my blog for the chance to find similarities and common ground within and between the sub-genres.
