Fantasy has always held a rather large chunk of any media, more specifically the UK's publishing industry sees fiction taking up 16% of its profits as of 2019. As well as this, in 2017 fantasy and sci-fi sold 3,225,915 units within the UK, making them the third best selling genre(s) of the year. With this it is obvious that these fantasy books are full of content that has been deemed worthwhile by the readers. However, the content is what kept the readers reading, not what made them decide to pick the book off of the shelf in the first place, at least if it were previously unknown to them. It is in fact the cover, the image, the name, the author and of course the typography. Typography associated with the genre and its art is impossible to deny within fantasy, for example 'Harry Potter' is practically a household name within the West and has seen many films and book editions and thus different typographic designs. However one thing that is certain is that the vast majority, if not all the instances contain serif and retains such a design throughout the texts on the covers. It is the reasoning behind decisions such as this that shall be explored throughout this blog. Questions such as "How does serif give this an air of fantasy?" and "What and how do certain colour choices convey in this typography?"
