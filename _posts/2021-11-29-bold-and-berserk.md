Fantasy media isn't just limited to the western world and ha done very well in countries such as Japan. One such piece of media that jumps out immediately from the rest of the crowd is the manga Berserk, created and illustrated by Kentaro Miura. 

Its take on dark fantasy has sent ripples through the genre for years to come and has become a cult classic. Because of this each edition of the manga has to have iconic and memorable iconography that reflects the content as well, especially the protagonist. With such as prominent and well done main character it is no wonder that the designers didn't want to lose that when it came to the designs of the physical mangas. With two main types of the manga there have been two main instances of the typography and so first we shall look at the single volume style.
