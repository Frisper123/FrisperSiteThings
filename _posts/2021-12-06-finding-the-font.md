Fonts have made their mark across the whole world and have brought in associations and preconceptions on the texts they form. In terms of fantasy there are many fonts that have made an impact on the genre and are seen throughout publications, especially their covers. 

First of all there are those fonts that aren't so far removed from what one may expect from a usual publication , such as educational. George R.R. Martin's 'A Song of Ice and Fire' can again be pulled in as an example of such fonts. What seems to be employed is a slightly modified version of Trajan Pro in the cover for both the author's name and the book title, a serif font.

It is modified in the sense that there are instances of serif flourishes being used on letters and in places on them that are not typical to the original Trajan Pro. This can be observed specifically on the upper case N in which uses serif on both its end points normally, but as seen on 'A Song of Ice and Fire' has a serif flourish on the middle point too. 

A more falmboyant and "flashy" use of font can be seen in the 'Earthsea' trilogy by Ursula K. Le Guin, specifically its Bantam Books edition. There we can see its use of what appears to be Hohenzollern, a font that doesn't have sharp, pointed serif but instead duller points that are at the end of looped lettering. The subtitling takes a step back from this whymsical feeling
