You can often tell which section of a bookstore you are standing in just by the covers of the books. Now of course seeing the words 'The Colour of Magic by Terry Pratchett' can prompt you into coming to the conclusion that you are in fact within the Fantasy shelves, but even if those letters were jumbled up into complete nonsense you would get a pretty sound idea. 

With serif everywhere and covers oozing with personality. The 'Harry Potter' series of books is an example of one of these series that immerses it's own typography into the contents of the books. A common factor among the many editions of the books has been a gold or silver serif with a notably low descender line. This lettering is reminiscent of the type of calligraphy that is used in the wizarding world of Harry Potter and the use of serif adds this layer of sophistication associated with the references to times such as 19th century Britain. 

What is also increasingly common within the fantasy genre is the use of more novelty elements within the typeface of a cover. Again going back to the Harry Potter books and its recent editions, within the 'O' of 'Potter' there is a lightning strike, an obvious reference to the scar upon the protagonist's forehead. The uniqueness of such a style not only intrigues a potential reader but also allows those that are already connected to the world to feel like they are purchasing a complete package. With 'Harry Potter' one is given a sense of wonder and grandeur which is highly fitting for a series almost completely focused around magic. On the other hand other book series such as 'The Lord of the Rings' convey the tone of their fantasy in a different manner. 

As can be seen on recent editions of Tolkein's 'The Lord of the Rings the typeface used for the main title has elements of wear and tear incorporated into it as well as an orange to yellow colouring to mimic the ring featured in the story. The potential reader is also intrigued by the type of tone and theme it conveys as well, whilst 'Harry Potter' has a harmless charm to its cover, 'The Lord of the Rings' conveys a grittier feel that gives the reader a reasonable expectation as to what is in store for them. With all these unique and different fantasy works upon the shelves stepping into the genre's area within a store has always been a massive treat and has prompted me to browse and try new works constantly.
